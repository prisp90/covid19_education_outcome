## NEAP directory

There are 2 sets of 8 files.  The excel files where downloaded from the NAEP website on June XX.  We then took the data and formatted it correctly into a new tab.  From that tab we exported the 8 CSV files.  We didn't want to mess with the NAEP JSON API, as that added a lot of unnecessary overhead, even though it would have been fun.

Each file represents the scores, by state, by grade (4th and 8th) and by subject (reading and math).  The scores are the state average scaled score on the corresponing test.  It includes some states that do not match up with the google data.  For example DDoE, which is the Department of Defense educational system.
